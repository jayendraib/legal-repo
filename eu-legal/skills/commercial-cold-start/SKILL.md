# /eu-legal:commercial-cold-start

1. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/CLAUDE.md`. If missing or has `[PLACEHOLDER]`, stop: "Run `/eu-legal:cold-start-interview` first — I need your base profile before setting up commercial contracts."
2. If `commercial.md` exists and is populated (no `[PLACEHOLDER]` values) and `--redo` is not passed: confirm before overwriting. "Your commercial playbook is already configured. Passing `--redo` will overwrite it. Do you want to continue?"
3. Run the interview workflow below.
4. Write `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/commercial.md`. Show summary. Offer first task: "Run `/eu-legal:contract-review` to review a contract, or `/eu-legal:nda-review` for an NDA."

---

## --redo

Force a full re-run of the interview and overwrite `commercial.md`. Use when the company's legal posture, governing law preference, or liability positions change.

## Interview workflow

Ask questions conversationally — one topic per message. Never dump all questions at once.

### 1. Governing law preference

Ask:
> "Which governing law does your organisation prefer for commercial contracts?"

Present as a numbered list:
1. Finnish law (Finland — Courts of Helsinki)
2. German law (Germany — choice of city)
3. English law (England & Wales)
4. Swedish law (Sweden)
5. Dutch law (Netherlands)
6. French law (France)
7. Other EU member state (specify)

Save the machine-readable code:
| Selection | Code |
|---|---|
| 1 | `finnish_law` |
| 2 | `german_law` |
| 3 | `english_law` |
| 4 | `swedish_law` |
| 5 | `dutch_law` |
| 6 | `french_law` |
| 7 | `other_eu` |

### 2. Dispute resolution

Ask:
> "What's your preferred dispute resolution mechanism for cross-border contracts?"

1. Finnish courts (District Court of Helsinki / Helsinki Court of Appeal)
2. ICC arbitration (seat: Paris; or specify another seat)
3. SCC arbitration (Stockholm Chamber of Commerce — seat: Stockholm)
4. LCIA arbitration (London Court of International Arbitration — seat: London)
5. German courts (choice of city)
6. Netherlands Arbitration Institute (NAI)
7. Other (specify)

Note: Finnish courts for contracts where both parties are Finnish; ICC/SCC for cross-border EU contracts. LCIA is recommended only for English-law agreements.

Save: `dispute_resolution_preferred`, `dispute_resolution_acceptable`, `dispute_resolution_never`.

### 3. Standard liability positions

Ask:
> "Let's set your liability positions. What's your standard direct liability cap — typically expressed as a multiple of fees paid in the preceding 12 months?"

- Standard: "12 months of fees paid in the 12 months preceding the claim"
- Acceptable fallbacks (ask): higher caps for data breach / IP infringement?
- Consequential damages: excluded (standard)? Ask for carve-outs (data breach, IP, gross negligence, fraud).
- Never accept: uncapped indirect liability.

Save: `liability_direct_cap`, `liability_indirect`, `liability_carveouts`, `liability_never`.

### 4. Sales-side playbook

Ask:
> "You're selling. Walk me through your standard positions. Let's start with IP ownership — does IP created under a services agreement stay with you (licensor model) or transfer to the customer (work-for-hire)?"

Cover:
- IP ownership and background IP licence
- Audit rights (what you grant customers)
- Data processing: do you process customer personal data? (If yes: reference your DPA template)
- Termination: standard notice period, termination for cause vs. convenience
- The one deal-breaker (what you will never accept from a customer)

Save as `sales_side_playbook` with sub-fields for each position.

### 5. Purchasing-side playbook

Ask:
> "You're buying. What do you require from vendors? Let's start: do you require vendors to sign YOUR DPA as processor, or will you accept their DPA template with redlines?"

Cover:
- DPA requirement (your paper / their paper with redlines / either)
- Audit rights you require from vendors
- Subcontracting: do you require approval rights over subcontractors?
- SLA minimum: what uptime / response time do you require?
- Never accept from a vendor (e.g., vendor retains rights to use your data for training, uncapped liability waiver)

Save as `purchasing_side_playbook`.

### 6. DORA ICT provider status

Ask:
> "Has your organisation identified its critical ICT third-party providers under DORA Article 28? (Relevant if you are a financial entity.)"

Read entity type from `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/CLAUDE.md`. If entity type is `other`, note that DORA ICT provider obligations may not apply directly but record the answer for context.

Options:
1. Yes — we maintain an ICT third-party register
2. Partially — we have an informal list but no formal register
3. No — we have not yet done this exercise
4. Not applicable — not a DORA-in-scope entity

Save: `dora_ict_register_status` (one of `formal_register` / `informal_list` / `not_done` / `not_applicable`).

If the answer is 1 or 2, ask:
> "You can list your critical ICT third-party providers here so the vendor-agreement-review skill can flag concentration risk. Do you want to add any now? (You can always add more later.)"

Save as `critical_ict_providers` (YAML list of vendor names).

### 7. Escalation thresholds

Ask:
> "Let's set your escalation matrix. Who can approve a contract, and at what threshold?"

Cover three levels (or fewer if a smaller team):
- Junior / paralegal / contract manager: threshold in EUR, what they can approve without escalation
- Lawyer / in-house counsel: threshold in EUR
- GC / head of legal: threshold in EUR
- Board / CFO: above GC threshold

Ask separately: automatic escalation triggers (regardless of EUR value):
- Any contract with governing law outside the EU?
- Any contract with a vendor that processes personal data outside the EU?
- Any ICT third-party agreement for a DORA-in-scope entity?
- Any contract with uncapped liability or IP assignment to the vendor?
- Liability cap below EUR [ask for threshold]?

Save: `escalation_matrix` (table), `escalation_auto_triggers` (list).
