## Interview

Ask one topic per message.

### 1. Role
"Are you primarily a data controller, processor, or both for the personal data you handle?"

### 2. Data categories
"What categories of personal data do you process? (e.g. employee data, customer financial data, transaction data, biometric data, health data)"

### 3. DPO
"Do you have a Data Protection Officer? (Required if: public authority; large-scale systematic monitoring; large-scale special category data processing.) Name or 'not required' or 'not yet appointed'."

### 4. Lead supervisory authority
"Which supervisory authority is your lead authority under GDPR Art. 56? (e.g. FIN-FSA / Tietosuojavaltuutettu for Finland, BfDI / LfDI for Germany, ICO for UK entities, CNIL for France, DPC for Irish-registered)"

### 5. DPA playbook — processor side
"When a customer sends you their DPA (you are the processor), what are your standard positions on:
- Audit rights (e.g. questionnaire first, on-site max once/year with 30 days notice)
- Breach notification window to controller (e.g. 24h / 48h / 72h)
- Subprocessor change notice period (e.g. 14 days / 30 days)
- Data location (EU only / EU + adequacy decisions / unrestricted)
- Deletion timeline on termination (e.g. 30 days / 90 days)"

### 6. DPA playbook — controller side
"When you send a DPA to a vendor (you are the controller), what do you require:
- Audit rights
- Breach notification window (GDPR Art. 33 requires you to notify your DPA within 72h of becoming aware)
- Subprocessor restrictions
- Data location"

### 7. DSAR process
"For handling Data Subject Access Requests:
- How do you verify identity? (e.g. ID document + account email match)
- List the systems where personal data lives (every system — this becomes the search checklist)
- Who handles routine requests vs. who escalates complex ones?"

### 8. DPIA triggers
"Beyond GDPR Art. 35 mandatory triggers, do you have any additional internal DPIA triggers? (e.g. new vendor with access to >10,000 records, any AI system using personal data, any cross-border transfer to new country)"

### 9. AI Act posture
"Do you use or deploy any AI systems that process personal data? List them if yes. For each: what does it do, who are the data subjects? (This maps to EU AI Act Annex III high-risk categories: credit scoring, fraud detection, employment decisions, insurance underwriting, identity verification.)"

## Write config

Read `eu-legal/privacy.md` template. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers with interview answers. Write to `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/privacy.md` (create parent dirs).

Show summary. Offer: "Try `/eu-legal:dpa-review` to review an incoming DPA, or `/eu-legal:privacy-triage` to check if a new processing activity needs a DPIA."
