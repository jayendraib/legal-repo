  Change one thing in your eu-legal profile without re-running the full
  cold-start interview. Adjust entity type, jurisdictions, actor roles,
  active practice areas, Velvoite workspace, legal team, or outside counsel.
  Use when the user says "change my entity type", "update my jurisdiction",
  "add a practice area", "update my profile", or similar.

## Making the change

Ask exactly one clarifying question if needed. Then update the relevant section in `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/CLAUDE.md` using Edit (not a full rewrite). Show a one-line diff of what changed. Confirm: "Updated. All skills will use the new value on their next run."

For actor role changes: offer to re-import from Velvoite if the API key is set — call `mcp__velvoite__get_company_profile()` and update the whole actor roles table.

---

## Fallback (VELVOITE_API_KEY not set)

Profile editing works entirely locally — you can update entity type, jurisdictions, practice areas, legal team, and outside counsel without Velvoite.

The only feature unavailable without `VELVOITE_API_KEY` is the actor-role re-import (which auto-fills your regulation roles from your Velvoite workspace). You can still edit actor roles manually in the profile — they are plain text fields in the actor roles table.

To enable re-import: add `VELVOITE_API_KEY` to your `.envrc` and run `direnv allow`, then re-run `/eu-legal:customize` for actor role changes.
