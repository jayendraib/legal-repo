# /billing:billing-report

## When this runs

Attorney or billing manager wants a broad view of billing activity — not a single entry or a single invoice, but a summary across time periods, clients, or attorneys.

## Instructions

### 1. Read config

Read `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/billing/CLAUDE.md`. Get `billing_data_path`. Check for placeholders.

### 2. Dispatch on flag

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Default (no flags): show the WIP dashboard.

---

### `--wip` or default: WIP dashboard

Show all unbilled time (status `pending` or `approved`) across all clients and attorneys. This is the "what's in the pipeline" view.

```markdown
## WIP Dashboard — as of [today]

| Client | Attorney | Pending entries | Pending hours | Pending amount | Approved (ready to bill) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acme Corp | Alice Jones | 3 | 2.4h | $840 | $420 |

| Gamma Inc | Bob Smith | 2 | 0.8h | $220 | $220 |

**Total WIP: [Nh]  ·  $[total]**
**Ready to invoice now: $[approved total] across [N] clients**

```

## What this skill does not do

- Generate or modify invoices — use `/billing:invoice-generate` and `/billing:wip-review`
- Send reports anywhere — outputs are in-conversation only; copy/paste to share
- Show reports for time before this plugin was installed — only entries in `time-register.yaml` are visible
