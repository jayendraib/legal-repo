# Red Judicial — Chile

Red Judicial brings the Chilean legal corpus into Claude. It exposes a single MCP tool, `redjudicial_search`, that performs semantic + lexical retrieval across three cross-linked sources:

- **Jurisprudence** — over 283,000 Chilean Supreme Court decisions, from January 2005 to the present, ingested with full text and indexed daily.
- **Statutes** — roughly 19,000 in-force norms from BCN / LeyChile (the official Chilean legislative repository), with article-level granularity.
- **Doctrine** — academic articles from open-access sources (SciELO, university repositories).

Each result returns a verifiable citation with a link back to the official source (Poder Judicial, BCN). The tool is read-only and does not write to user systems.

For Spanish-speaking practitioners and firms in Chile and Latin America. See [README.es.md](./README.es.md) for the Spanish version.

## Example use cases

1. Research how the Chilean Supreme Court has ruled on `lucro cesante` (loss of profits) in commercial liability cases over the last five years.
2. Retrieve the in-force version of an article of the Civil Code along with the most recent rulings interpreting it.
3. Cross-reference a Supreme Court holding on labor dismissal with academic doctrine on `despido injustificado`.
4. Build a memo summarizing the dominant criteria of a specific Chilean Supreme Court justice on tax matters (when used together with the public Red Judicial product).

## When to Use

- Questions answerable from Chilean caselaw, statutes, or open-access doctrine.
- Locating the current text of a Chilean statute, decree, or regulation, and its most recent jurisprudential interpretation.
- Cross-source research that combines a Supreme Court holding, the underlying statutory framework, and academic commentary.
- Comparative research between Chilean jurisprudence and Latin American hispanophone jurisdictions (planned expansion).

## When Not to Use

- U.S. or other non-Chilean primary law — out of corpus today. See `cocounsel-legal` for U.S. caselaw and Practical Law.
- Court of Appeals or first-instance decisions — ingestion in progress, not yet in the default index.
- Constitutional Tribunal jurisprudence — ingestion planned (Phase 2).
- Administrative decisions (Contraloría, SII, CMF) — planned, not yet available.
- Real-time docket monitoring of specific cases — not supported.
- Drafting Chilean pleadings or contracts — Red Judicial provides primary-source research; drafting is left to the attorney.
- Outcome predictions for a specific case — the corpus supports research, not prediction.

## Authentication

The MCP server at `https://ia.redjudicial.cl/mcp/v1` is OAuth 2.0 protected with **Dynamic Client Registration** (RFC 7591) and **PKCE** (RFC 7636). Clients that support DCR — including Claude.ai web Custom Connectors — discover the authorization server through the standard metadata endpoint at `https://ia.redjudicial.cl/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414) and register themselves automatically. No pre-shared client ID is needed.

End users sign in with their Red Judicial account and grant the connector consent before the tool becomes available.

## Subscription and billing

Red Judicial uses a credit-based model with five subscription tiers. Each call to `redjudicial_search` consumes one credit. A monthly free allowance is available; paid tiers extend the cap and unlock additional tools as they roll out (`redjudicial_get_norm`, `redjudicial_get_sentence`, `redjudicial_research_brief` — planned).

## Compliance with the partner-plugin technical bar

This plugin satisfies the five criteria documented in [`CONNECTORS.md`](../../CONNECTORS.md):

1. **HTTPS + OAuth 2.0** with Dynamic Client Registration and PKCE on the streamable HTTP transport at `/mcp/v1`.
2. **Read-heavy tools only.** `redjudicial_search` performs retrieval only; no writes to user systems.
3. **Provenance on every result.** Each hit returns `citation`, `url` (link to the official source), and `source` (`jurisprudencia` / `ley` / `doctrina`).
4. **No instructional content in tool results.** Tool responses are data plus structured metadata (`result_quality`, `suggested_followups`, `display_hints`); no embedded directives to the calling model.
5. **Graceful error degradation.** 401 (unauthenticated), 402 (out of credits), 5xx (upstream) are returned with clean JSON-RPC error codes and human-readable messages, plus `suggested_followups` where applicable.
